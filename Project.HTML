               <p class="font1 margin-auto">We started with a bare shell for this apartment and molded it according to
                    the client’s needs. It is a space that makes you feel right at home. Using linear as well as curved
                    forms, this apartment has a soul of its own. The space has been segregated by the material and
                    colour, formal spaces in a neutral palette and the informal spaces being highlighted with pops of
                    colour. Using furniture from high end international brands such as Gallotti and Radice, Roche
                    Bobois, Giorgetti, Baxter, as well as Indian brands and designers such as Arjun Rathi, Minotti,
                    Bombay Design Labs and Hatsu, this house has it all. The difficult task in hand was to give more and
                    more storage. Allocation of spaces for everyone was tricky but a fun part. The overall design
                    aesthetic of the House was Modern and minimal, but definitely not without the Drama with some poppy
                    aesthetic colors.</p>

               <p class="font1 margin-auto">Breaking the monotony of being an austere training studio, the box is
                    blended with a mix of raw concrete, American loft and an urban jungle design concept which makes it
                    a rejuvenating space in the crossfit world.

                    The workspace in the studio features a ‘no false ceiling’ look with lights hanging directly and a
                    dramatic hexagon iron rod which acts as a design rack to display décor products and books. Inside,
                    raw finish paints in orange and black motivate people with an array of inspirational quotes and
                    words sealed on the grainy walls.

                    The fitness space also features a small waiting room with an open pantry, a workout room and a
                    bookshelf for booklovers to cling into

                    Getting its design inspiration from cafes in Europe with planters hanging from ceilings, the space
                    sets an inviting environment for its visitors with its nonchalant lighting and a cosy café vibe,
                    which blends well with setting.</p>
